## Abstract
Multiple confounding crises ranging from climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and violent armed conflict in Ukraine have recently caused a global decline in human development for the first time in over three decades (Conceição, 2022). Conflict disrupts elections, which are foundational to a functioning democracy, reducing or corrupting electoral participation and destabilizing democracies (Norris, 2014). This research advances Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for predictive conflict modeling by employing a novel methodology to predict election-related fatalities during Kenya’s 2017 national elections using features of global news from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The current study consists of three stages: Part 1 builds a ML model to identify the most important risk factors of election-related violence across historical elections globally; Part 2 curates a dataset of global news articles that discuss the top election violence risk factors identified in Part 1; From this curated news data, Part 3 uses the news text at time T to predict the presence of election related fatalities at time T+1. Reported results are comparable to similar research (Mueller & Rauh, 2018; 2022), measured by the area under the Receiver Operator Curve equal to 0.77. This research exemplifies the use of data science and ML for anticipatory policy making by forecasting specific characteristics of conflict with the aim of minimizing the social and economic impacts of violence.
