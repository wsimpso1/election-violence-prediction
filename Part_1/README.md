# Part 1: Risk Factors of Election Violence

To model historical risk factors of election violence, Part 1 utilizes two data inputs: NELDA provides the independent variables (i.e., 58 features characterizing national-level elections around the world from 1945-2020); DECO provides the target variable to be predicted by the model (i.e., the sum of election related fatalities in that country during the year of their election). Each record in NELDA corresponds to a particular country during a particular year. DECO on the other hand is an events-level dataset that codes the number of fatalities associated with election violence, thus to be compatible with NELDA, DECO is aggregated to the country-year level. This allows both datasets to be merged. 

A preprocessed dataset served to train a RF model to classify the sum of election violence fatalities, according to DECO, for a given election in NELDA. Once this model is optimized via hyperparameter tuning, permutation importance is used to determine feature importances. Permutation importance is a strategy to measure the decrease in model performance as the result of randomly shuffling one feature at a time. More important features in the modelâ€™s final decision will cause a larger drop in model performance when shuffled. The final output of Part 1 is the list of the most important features (i.e., risk factors of election violence), which is used as an input to Part 2
